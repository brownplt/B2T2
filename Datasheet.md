## Reference

> Q. Where can we learn about the programming medium covered by this datasheet?
> (Feel free to link to multiple kinds of artifacts: repositories, papers, videos, etc.
> Please also include version information where applicable.)


> Q. What is the URL of the version of the benchmark being used?


> Q. On what date was this version of the datasheet last updated?


> Q. If you are not using the latest benchmark available on that date, please explain why not.


## Example Tables

> Q. Do tables express heterogeneous data, or must data be homogenized?


> Q. Do tables capture missing data and, if so, how?


> Q. Are mutable tables supported? Are there any limitations?


> You may reference, instead of duplicating, the responses to the above questions in answering those below:

> Q. Which tables are inexpressible? Why?


> Q. Which tables are only partially expressible? Why, and what’s missing?


> Q. Which tables’ expressibility is unknown? Why?


> Q. Which tables can be expressed more precisely than in the benchmark? How?


> Q. How direct is the mapping from the tables in the benchmark to representations in your system? How complex is the encoding?


## TableAPI

> Q. Are there consistent changes made to the way the operations are represented?


> Q. Which operations are entirely inexpressible? Why?


> Q. Which operations are only partially expressible? Why, and what’s missing?


> Q. Which operations’ expressibility is unknown? Why?


> Q. Which operations can be expressed more precisely than in the benchmark? How?


## Example Programs

> Q. Which examples are inexpressible? Why?


> Q. Which examples’ expressibility is unknown? Why?


> Q. Which examples, or aspects thereof, can be expressed especially precisely? How?


> Q. How direct is the mapping from the pseudocode in the benchmark to representations in your system? How complex is the encoding?


## Errors

> There are (at least) two parts to errors: representing the source program that causes the error, and generating output that explains it. The term “error situation” refers to a representation of the cause of the error in the program source.
> 
> For each error situation it may be that the language:
> 
> - isn’t expressive enough to capture it
> - can at least partially express the situation
> - prevents the program from being constructed
> 
> Expressiveness, in turn, can be for multiple artifacts:
> 
> - the buggy versions of the programs
> - the correct variants of the programs
> - the type system’s representation of the constraints
> - the type system’s reporting of the violation

> Q. Which error situations are known to be inexpressible? Why?


> Q. Which error situations are only partially expressible? Why, and what’s missing?


> Q. Which error situations’ expressibility is unknown? Why?


> Q. Which error situations can be expressed more precisely than in the benchmark? How?


> Q. Which error situations are prevented from being constructed? How?


> Q. For each error situation that is at least partially expressible, what is the quality of feedback to the programmer?


> Q. For each error situation that is prevented from being constructed, what is the quality of feedback to the programmer?
