## Implement B2T2 in Empirical

### Limitations

 - Tables are only permitted to contain builtin datatypes.
 - Tons of table-management convenience functions are missing.
 - Type system is too primitive for generic higher-order functions.
 - String-handling is fairly non-existent.

### Credits

 - Christopher C. Aycock
